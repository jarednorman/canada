Canada: _Define you some permissions_
=====================================

**NOTE:** If you're concerned by the fact that this repository has very little
activity, don't be. The functionality this package provides is very simple, it
has no dependencies, and the Elixir language hasn't changed in any way that
would break it. It still works just as well as when I first wrote it. :smiley:

Canada provides a friendly interface for making easy use of
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)'s excellent pattern matching to create
readable declarative permission rules.

If you're looking for something that fills more of what CanCan would provide
you in a Rails application you should have a look at
[Canary](https://github.com/cpjk/canary) which adds Ecto/Plug support.

Installation
------------

Add it to your deps list in your `mix.exs`. You want the latest release?

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:canada, "~> 2.0"}]
end
```

You want the latest master?

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:canada, github: "jarednorman/canada"}]
end
```

Becoming Canadian
-----------------

Becoming Canadian is easy. Presumably you have some kind of resource like a
user, and probably some kind of resource that belongs to users. Let's call that
hypothetical resource a "post". Let's say they're structs.

```elixir
defmodule User do
  defstruct id: nil, name: nil, admin: false
end

defmodule Post do
  defstruct user_id: nil, content: nil
end
```

To make use of Canada, you need to implement the `Canada.Can` protocol
(defining whatever rules you need) for the "subject" resource (your User struct
in this case).

```elixir
defimpl Canada.Can, for: User do
  def can?(%User{id: user_id}, action, %Post{user_id: user_id})
    when action in [:update, :read, :destroy, :touch], do: true

  def can?(%User{admin: admin}, action, _)
    when action in [:update, :read, :destroy, :touch], do: admin

  def can?(%User{}, :create, Post), do: true
end
```

With this in place, you're good to start testing permissions wherever you need
to, just remember to import the can? macro.

```elixir
import Canada, only: [can?: 2]

if some_user |> can? read(some_post) do
  # render the post
else
  # sorry (raise a 403)
end
```

A note from the author
----------------------

This is very much what happened when I said to myself, "I want the thing I had
in Ruby, but in Elixir." I would be entirely unsurprised if myself or someone
else comes up with a more "functional" solution. That said, permissions are
necessarily a matter that governs conditional logic, so I currently see this as
a reasonable solution.
